Hello there! If you're reading this, you've probably stumbled upon our little gem, PhotoLabs. It's not just any photo viewing app; it's a labor of love, a testament to the beauty of photographs, and a playground for React enthusiasts like us! Let's dive into what makes PhotoLabs a fantastic project and how you can get it up and running.

## What's PhotoLabs?

PhotoLabs is a single-page application (SPA) built with React, created by a bunch of photo aficionados who also happen to love coding. Our goal was simple: craft a delightful, user-friendly platform for photo exploration. It's all about delivering an immersive experience, where every click brings a new surprise, and every photo tells a story.

## Behind the Scenes

As creators, we're proud of the tech stack behind PhotoLabs. Our client-side is a React SPA, and we've poured our heart into making it both functional and fun. On the server side, we've got a solid PostgreSQL database coupled with a Node.js server running Express.js. It's like the perfect blend of coffee - strong, robust, and gets the job done.

### Why React?

We chose React for its simplicity and power. Our code leverages hooks like `useReducer` and `useEffect` to manage state and side-effects, making our app responsive and dynamic. We wanted to create an app that's as enjoyable to use as it is to build.
